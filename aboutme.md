My name is Jefferson Lee. I've lived in Australia, Indonesia, and the U.S.A. I'm a current student at Texas A&M University, class of 2022 (aye aye aye aye aye), majoring in mechanical engineering (BS) with a minor in business. I am currently trading using TDAmeritrade. I'm a gutiar novice, watch enthusiast, and loves traveling.
