Learning basics of SoldiWorks.
Currently self learning Python, familiarizing in Tkinter and Py2app.

Creating standalone application from python on Mac.
Thanks to marinamele.com for great tutorial.

open terminal and cd to folder of python file
```
cd Desktop/code/fees
```
```
pip install -U py2app
```
replace ### with file name
```
py2applet --make-setup ###.py
```
if using older version of python, try python instead of python3
```
python3 setup.py py2app -A                         
```
