title: The Semester of Memos
---

I have updated the engineering tab with new work: a short memo on the kinematics of a crankshaft and another one on electromagnetic relays.
I am almost halfway done with my 5th semester as a mechanical engineer at Texas A&M University! I have named this semester, "the semester of memos."
I have created a handful of memos within a few weeks, which was a big step from just learning how to format one properly.
