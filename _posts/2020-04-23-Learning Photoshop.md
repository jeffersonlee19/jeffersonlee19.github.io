I wanted to design a new logo and I decided to use photoshop for this. I followed a great tutorial from the youtuber Photoshop Tutorials | Photo effects
/ Tutorials junction. After a while I settled with grey as a textured wood design caused some readability issues. I still need to change 
the subtitle due to visibility issues.
