Started the year strong with acquisitions of big 'dividend aristocrats' while building up cash, only to find the end
of the long bull market. Sold off BA during the sell-off and used the cash to try and recover losses through option trading.
Currently adding big blue chip stocks slowly while holding puts for protection.
