title: End of the Bear?

It's been a while since the drop started, and after only a few weeks later the markets have recovered back up to only be 20% down
from all time highs. Currently, my dividends from just the first 3 months of 2020 is already 2/3 (67.34%) of my total dividends
collected in the 2019 calandar year, goes to show how strong selective picking and compounding works.
