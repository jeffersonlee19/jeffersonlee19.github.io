title: Studying for CSWA
---

I'm attempting to obtain my CSWA (Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate) by the end of the next 3 months. I already have most of the skills for
this task, however I need to polish up on a few thinsg as well as laerning some new tricks and methods to navigate through this exam.
So far the progress has been great!
